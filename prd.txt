### 1. Introduction & Vision

**1.1. Overview**
"FlixFolio" is a personal portfolio website designed to function as an interactive, dynamic, and memorable digital resume. The project's core concept is to present a candidate's professional story—work experience, education, and skills—using the universally recognized user interface and interaction patterns of the Netflix streaming platform.

**1.2. Problem Statement**
In a competitive job market, traditional text-based resumes often fail to capture a recruiter's attention or effectively showcase the depth and impact of a candidate's work. They lack personality and can be difficult to scan for key achievements.

**1.3. Vision & Goal**
The vision is to create a "binge-worthy" resume experience. By leveraging a familiar and engaging UI, FlixFolio will immediately differentiate the candidate, encourage deeper exploration of their qualifications, and provide a sophisticated platform to showcase both technical skills (through the site's execution) and professional accomplishments (through its content).

**The primary goal is to secure more high-quality interview opportunities by leaving a lasting, positive impression on recruiters and hiring managers.**

### Core Value Proposition

- **Memorable:** Distinctive presentation that stands out from traditional resumes
- **Engaging:** Interactive exploration encourages deeper engagement with content
- **Scalable:** Modular structure allows easy content updates and expansions
- **Professional:** Sophisticated design maintains credibility while being innovative
- **Intuitive:** I can intuitively navigate different sections of the candidate's background

### 2. Target Audience

1. **Technical Recruiters:** They are often the first point of contact. They need to quickly scan for key technologies, companies, and role durations. The website must be fast, clear, and easy to navigate.
2. **Hiring Managers & Team Leads:** They dive deeper into the content. They want to understand the *impact* of projects, the candidate's role, and the technologies used. The detailed "expanded view" is for them.
3. **Fellow Engineers & Network Contacts:** They may appreciate the technical execution of the website itself as a demonstration of skill.
